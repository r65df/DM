I have all the info added already, I just need someone to add the formulas needed to make it work correctly. Its just a weekly master report, that needs to collect data each person enters and totals quarterly and yearly with a master final page that totals all so you dont have to go in each page to find all the info.


recording consumer admit and discharge, start is service and end of service, total hours, change in hours or payer source, landing page total hours weekly for the year with all office and percentages total Quaternary, all color coded and exasperated by office. And year end totals, I would like to also add 1. Separate tabs for each office with add'l sub tabs for specific data 2. Merge the Pending and New Cases tab keeping line to mark cases Active once started. 3. If 1 person is editing a sheet, the sheet is locked and cannot be edited by anyone else 4. Lock cells once info is entered and only that office has access to edit that cell. 5. Color Coding for each office 6. Create a Tab that would pull all data from existing/current tabs and put one form to be able to view multiple offices at one time. 7. Utilizing Excel Go To Feature which allows for easier access for office info and getting to out of the way data.. With all information compiling to one signal master page.
